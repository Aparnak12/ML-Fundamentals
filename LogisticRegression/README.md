1. What nonlinear basis functions $\phi$ would you choose to solve the logistic regression problem?
2. Start with a binary classier and implement the gradient descent solution for minimizing the
Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) with your proposed basis $\phi$.
3. How can one extend a binary classier for multi-class classication? Implement a multi-class
classier, based on your binary classier in part 2.
4. Report your final test accuracy. If your test accuracy is smaller than 90% you might want to
re-evaluate your choice of $\phi$!
