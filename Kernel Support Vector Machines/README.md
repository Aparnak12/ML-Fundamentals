1. What nonlinear kernel function k(. , .) would you choose to solve this classification problem?
2. Start with a binary classifier and implement kernel SVM for your chosen kernel from scratch. Use the CVXOP package to solve the Quadratic
Programming problem for the Dual form.
3. Extend your binary classifier into a multi-class classifier.
4. Report your final test accuracy. If your test accuracy is smaller than 90% you might want to
re-evaluate your choice of kernel!
